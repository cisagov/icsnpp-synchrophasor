# ICSNPP-Synchrophasor

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Synchrophasor Data Transfer for Power Systems (C37.118) over TCP and UDP.

## Overview

ICSNPP-Synchrophasor is a Zeek plugin (written in [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/)) for parsing and logging fields used by the Synchrophasor protocol as presented in IEEE standard C37.118, defining a transmission format for reporting synchronized phasor measurements in power systems.

This parser produces the following log files, defined in [analyzer/main.zeek](analyzer/main.zeek):

* `synchrophasor.log`
* `synchrophasor_cmd.log`
* `synchrophasor_hdr.log`
* `synchrophasor_cfg.log`
* `synchrophasor_cfg_detail.log`
* `synchrophasor_data.log`
* `synchrophasor_data_detail.log`

For additional information on this log file, see the *Logging Capabilities* section below.

## Installation

### Package Manager

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html). Zeek includes Spicy support by default as of [v6.0.0](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/releases/tag/v6.0.0).

```bash
$ zkg refresh
$ zkg install icsnpp-synchrophasor
```

If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_SPICY_SYNCHROPHASOR_TCP` and `ANALYZER_SPICY_SYNCHROPHASOR_UDP` under the list of `Zeek::Spicy` analyzers.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

## Installation (via git clone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-synchrophasor.git
cd icsnpp-synchrophasor
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ..
```

From here you can install the locally built files through `zkg install ./icsnpp-synchrophasor` and run it like you would normally.

Or you can manually run the parser without installing it: `zeek ./build/synchrophasor.hlto ./analyzer/__load__.zeek  -Cr <pcap>`

## Logging Capabilities

### Synchrophasor Log (synchrophasor.log)

#### Overview

This log summarizes, by connection, Synchrophasor frames transmitted over 4712/tcp or 4713/udp to `synchrophasor.log`. The port can be overriden by redefining the `synchrophasor_ports_tcp` and `synchrophasor_ports_udp` variables, respectively, e.g.:

```
$ zeek -C -r synchrophasor_tcp.pcap local "SYNCHROPHASOR::synchrophasor_ports_tcp={ 40712/tcp }"
```

### Synchrophasor Configuration PMU Details (synchrophasor_cfg_detail.log)

#### Overview

This log lists the per-PMU details from synchrophasor Configuration (CFG-1, CFG-2, and CFG-3) frames. As this can be very verbose, this log file is **disabled** by default. Users can enable it by appending `SYNCHROPHASOR::log_cfg_detail=T` to the `zeek` command on the command line or by adding `redef SYNCHROPHASOR::log_cfg_detail = T;` to the `local.zeek` file.

#### Fields Captured

Most of the fields listed here are optional. Many may be unused during communication depending on device configuration. See IEEE Std C37.118.2-2011 for more details.

### Synchrophasor Data Frame Log (synchrophasor_data.log)

#### Overview

This log summarizes synchrophasor Data frames. As this can be very verbose, this log file is **disabled** by default. You can enable it by appending `SYNCHROPHASOR::log_data_frame=T` to your `zeek` command on the command line or by adding `redef SYNCHROPHASOR::log_data_frame = T;` to your `local.zeek` file.

### Synchrophasor Data PMU Details Log (synchrophasor_data_detail.log)

#### Overview

This log lists the per-PMU details from synchrophasor Data frames. As this can be very verbose, this log file is **disabled** by default. You can enable it by appending `SYNCHROPHASOR::log_data_detail=T` to your `zeek` command on the command line or by adding `redef SYNCHROPHASOR::log_data_detail = T;` to your `local.zeek` file. Note that `log_data_frame` described above must also be set to `T` for `log_data_detail` to take effect.

Most of the fields listed here are optional. Many may be unused during communication depending on device configuration. See IEEE Std C37.118.2-2011 for more details.
